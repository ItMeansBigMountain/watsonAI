When started, bot will build json files of settings and server db
use graphing.py to run analytics after the api.py is hosting all json files from dir


Flaw is that the db is json and should have a REST api hosted from django models posted from main.py
    just change the inputs into the db (writing of file)
    build REST with endpoints to add user, chats, stats whenever there are events.





api keys are stripped
    discord - bottom of the code | main.py
    watson -   login()           | watson.py

all end points need to be configured with cloud computer public DNS ip

tone analysis was depreciated so I removed the seperate functions
    functionality is the exact same without.
